## How to Use This Library

To use `@reliverse/core`, ensure that your project is set up as an ES module by including `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file. Since this package is structured as an ES module, you'll need to use `import` statements instead of `require`.

Here's an example of how to import and use a function from this package:

```ts
import { [functionName] } from "@reliverse/core";

const someFile = "path/to/file";

export async function exampleFunction() {
  await [functionName](someFile);
}
```

Please refer to the source files located in the [`src` folder](https://github.com/reliverse/core/blob/main/src) to learn about the currently implemented functions.

This package adopts the ES module format, with files compiled to `dist/.js`. This aligns with the Node.js team's recent recommendations, encouraging the JavaScript/TypeScript community to transition to the ES module standard. If your project still requires CommonJS (CJS) support, you may fork this repository and modify the build process to generate `dist/.cjs` files.
